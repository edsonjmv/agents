My name is Edson Machado. I'm a software designer. I'm originally from Valencia, Venezuela, but I moved to Madrid in 2017 and then to LA in 2025.
I love exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and trying new things wherever I go. I’m also passionate about sports, whether it’s playing, watching, or just staying active, I’m always up for a challenge.
